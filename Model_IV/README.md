# Model IV

This data set constitutes simulations that are close to those in our original papers but with changes to the instument systematics to approximate an Euclid survey and the use of real images of galaxies for lensing.

## Source galaxy
- A processed image of a *real* galaxy 
- Single channel

## Instrument
- Images are 64 x 64 pixels
- Modeled after Euclid observation characteristics as done by default in lenstronomy.

## Dark matter classes
- No substructure
- Axion (vortex)
- CDM (point mass subhalos)


## Model IV Data set

30,000 images per class. Axion files have extra data corresponding to mass of axion used in simulation.

Training data is found [here]()

## Model IV Test set

5,000 images per class. Axion files have extra data corresponding to mass of axion used in simulation.

Testing data is found [here]()
