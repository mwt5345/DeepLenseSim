This data set constitutes simulations that most closely match those in our original papers but now in lenstronomy.

# Source galaxy
- Modeled with simple Sersic light profile 
- Single channel

# Instrument
- Images are 150 x 150 pixels
- Modeled with a Gaussian point spread function
- Added background and noise for SNR of around 25

# Dark matter classes
- No substructure
- Axion (vortex)
- CDM (point mass subhalos)
