# Model I

This data set constitutes simulations that most closely match those in our original papers but now in lenstronomy.

## Source galaxy
- Modeled with simple Sersic light profile 
- Single channel

## Instrument
- Images are 150 x 150 pixels
- Modeled with a Gaussian point spread function
- Added background and noise for SNR of around 25

## Dark matter classes
- No substructure
- Axion (vortex)
- CDM (point mass subhalos)


## Model I Data set

30,000 images per class. Axion files have extra data corresponding to mass of axion used in simulation.

## Model I Test set

5,000 images per class. Axion files have extra data corresponding to mass of axion used in simulation.
