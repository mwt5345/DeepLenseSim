# Model III

This data set constitutes simulations that are close to those in our original papers but with changes to the instument systematics to approximate a HST survey.

## Source galaxy
- Modeled with simple Sersic light profile 
- Single channel

## Instrument
- Images are 64 x 64 pixels
- Modeled after HST observation characteristics as done by default in lenstronomy.

## Dark matter classes
- No substructure
- Axion (vortex)
- CDM (point mass subhalos)


## Model III Data set

30,000 images per class. Axion files have extra data corresponding to mass of axion used in simulation.

## Model III Test set

5,000 images per class. Axion files have extra data corresponding to mass of axion used in simulation.
